## Data Sets Used

[Data](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/data) scraped and uploaded to Kaggle. A few modifications from the original dataset that was uploaded to Kaggle:

* Sampled 50,000 data points from the full dataset.
* Dirtied the dataset a bit to more closely resemble what you would expect from a scraped dataset (the version uploaded to Kaggle was cleaned to be easier to work with).
